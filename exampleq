this what pydantic expects we run a query : 
class respond_post(BaseModel): #so here we define the schema of our respond to the client while the previous ones were for setting the schema of request
title: str
content: str
published: bool
created_at: datetime     
owner_id: int
owner: User_response # User_response should be above our class so that this line of code can recognize it

[
    {
        "title": "smt",
        "content": "good\n",
        "published": true,
        "created_at": "2024-03-01T21:38:59.299025+01:00",
        "owner_id": 5,
        "owner": {
            "id": 5,
            "email": "bana@gmail.com"
        }
    }
