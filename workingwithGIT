so to track our code and store our code we will work with github:

but to ensure that not all of our files checking in github that carries confidential information we created a file and named .gitignore 
so go there and see what we included


then on command prompt we run "pip freeze"  which shows the list of packages we installed , so we gonna create a new file which will contain all of them so that the github users can see what packages are needed for these codes to work,the code we run on cd: 
pip freeze > requirements.txt

so anyone that goes to this file requirements.txt instead of installing one by one they can just type to command prompt and install them all at one click : pip install -r requirements.txt

so we downloaded git to our computer

we went to our github accout that we signed in and create repository
to initialize git on our project folder we type in the following commands to command prompt window: 

git init
git add --all
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Bedrn12/bedran.git
git push -u origin main
