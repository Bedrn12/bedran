the development environment is where software is developed and tested, while the production environment is where it's deployed and used by real users.

- on postman instead of hard coding the urls all the time , everyitme we move back and forward from dev to prod , we can create environments on postman 

-on postman we go to tests and set an environment variable and we pass in this value pm.environment.set("JWT", "pm.response.json().access_token");   here jwt represents the key and the other one represents our token that we generated

then we go to our posts environment there in authorization and pass in the {{JWT}} and choose as type the bearer token so it will automatically updates everytime we change our token
